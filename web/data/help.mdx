1. Input display shows which buttons where held on the previous frame.
2. Status display defaults to first enemy's HP, but can be configured to show Charge Timer, X-Factor timer, Shinespark timer and more (see InfoHUD Modes).
3. Current total energy (excluding reserves), sometimes overridden by status display contents.
4. Status icon display can be enabled to show when you have a shinespark stored, health bomb flag, and more.
5. Segment timer in minutes.seconds.frames. Resets when starting a new game, loading a preset, or by controller/menu shortcut.
6. Room timer in seconds.frames, resets when entering a new room and updates on item acquisition and room transitions. Can be set to realtime or gametime.
7. Lag frames, updates same as above.
8. Frames spent by last door transition. Door alignment time is printed before the transition, and total time after the transition.
9. Item collection percentage, which can be configured to show reserve energy instead.

# Built-In Savestate Feature

The savestate feature allows you to save and instantly reload at nearly any part of gameplay. This is achieved by transferring all of the console's working memory and video memory into the battery backed storage on the cartridge, also known as SRAM. It requires a very large amount of SRAM to store all of that data. Much more than commercial games offered (or needed), even though it was possible at the time. As a result, many platforms (including official Virtual Console releases) do not allow saving more than 64K or 128K of SRAM, while 256K is needed for full savestate support. Platforms known to support 256K include FXPAK (formerly known as SD2SNES), bsnes and Mesen-S emulators, Snes9x 1.61, and the Super NT when equipped with the "jailbreak" firmware.
&nbsp;
A separate version of the practice hack is offered with a modified version of savestates. It offers the same features of normal savestates, but uses some of the game's own loading routines to reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored. This brings the SRAM requirements down to 128K. The trade-off is that the saved state takes slightly longer to restore. Most modern PC emulators will work with this version. The older Everdrive flash carts are also supported. Using custom Samus sprites on this version may require turning on Compressed Graphics/Palettes/Tables in Preset Options (see Sprite Patches below).
&nbsp;
If you experience crashes or severe glitches when using savestates, your platform may not be supported. It's recommended that you use a version of the practice hack without the built-in savestate feature. You can still use any savestate functionality offered by your platform.

|                               | This only works if "Room Strat" is selected as the above Infohud Mode.
| - Top-Left Display            | Choose item collection percentage, reserve energy, or vanilla health to be displayed at the top-left of the HUD.
|                               | The vanilla option also compresses the viewable area so it is more suitable for practice on an curved CRT monitor or TV.
| - Frames Held Mode            | Replaces the controller input display with numbers representing the frames held.
|                               | Any or all of the 12 controller inputs can be individually toggled into frames held mode.

|                               | This is to compensate for the lack of a minimap on the HUD which would normally consume CPU cycles.
| - Customize RAM Watch         | Setup addresses to be monitored by the RAM Watch HUD mode. Address 1 will appear in the bottom-left corner of the HUD, while Address 2 appears just to the right of Address 1. Memory at these locations can be edited by configuring a Value and selecting 'Write to Address'. Toggle 'Lock Value' to automatically write the value once every frame. RAM Watch must must be the selected HUD mode to continue writing to the address. Only one byte of hex can be configured at a time in the menu. 'Hi' refers to the first byte, while 'Lo' refers to the second. Set the Hi Address to 0D and the Lo Address to EC to monitor the memory address $0DEC, which stores the counter for Samus direction changes while held by Draygon (among other uses). You can find lists of known RAM addresses by selecting 'Select Common Addresses'.
| **Timer Settings**            | Located within the Infohud menu
| - Frame Counters              | Toggle the room timer in the top-right of the HUD between realtime, gametime, and "speedrun time".
|                               | - Speedrun time is like realtime, except it includes time that was skipped due to practice hack features like shortened item fanfares, boss intros, door transitions, or elevators. This way, rooms and segments measured in the practice hack can be accurately compared to times from an actual run.
| - Transition Lag              | Toggle the door time to include the full length of the room transition.
| - Auto-Update Timers          | Option to turn off room timer updates when riding elevators or grabbign items

| - Large Enemy Hitboxes        | Toggles an overlay of enemy hitboxes for the following enemies that use the extended spritemap format: Mother Brain, Ridley, Draygon, Torizos, Spore Spawn, Crocomire, Ceres steam, Oums, and Space Pirates. Kraid would be in this list, but it is unsupported due to too many sprites being drawn.
| - Special Boss Hitboxes       | Toggles an overlay of Mother Brain's special hitboxes or Ridley's tail hitbox.
| - Samus Projectile Hitbox     | Toggles an overlay of Samus projectile hitboxes that are drawn on top of Samus projectile sprites.

| - OOB Tile Viewer             | This enables an overlay that shows the tiles near Samus at all times, disconnected from the camera. This allows you to navigate OOB (Out of Bounds) areas where neither Samus nor the actual tiles are visible in-game. Samus hitbox is drawn at the center of the overlay to show the position relative to the tiles.
| - Spacetime HUD               | Option to preserve the infohud when firing the spacetime beam.

|                               | Note: This mode is not recommended if intentionally triggering out-of-bounds door transitions.
| - Door Portal I-Frames        | Option to give Samus 128 invulnerability frames when she goes through the custom portal.
| - Horizontal Mirroring        | Aligns any two area/boss portals with left or right doors.  If necessary, mirrors Samus horizontally across the room prior to door scroll.
| - Next Door Jump To Dest      | Temporarily sets the destination of the next door or elevator that you enter.
| - Select Portal Source        | Choose one of of the two area/boss portal connections (8 boss portals and 32 area portals supported).
| - Select Portal Destination   | Choose the other portal connection, also the one used for Next Door Jump To Dest.
| - Select Portal Door          | Choose a pair of aligned left/right or up/down portal connections.  Note that some up doors do not exist in the vanilla game (some of the ones requiring you to go up through falling sand) so those cannot be travelled going up.
|&nbsp;|
| **Game**                      | Toggle game options
| - Japanese/French Text        | Standard game option to toggle between English and Japanese text (NTSC) or between German and French text (PAL).

| - Low Health Alarm            | Modify the behavior of the low-health alarm
|                               | Never = Self-explanatory
|                               | Vanilla = No change (triggers on when <=30 health, off when >30 health, ignoring reserves, breaks if power bomb explosion is active)
|                               | PB Fix = Defers trigger during power bomb explosions, which fixes issue where the alarm may not turn on or turn off
|                               | Improved = PB Fix + only triggers on with health+reserves is less than 30 (same requirements as initiating health bomb)
| - Minimap                     | Restores the game minimap, which also allows the pause menu map to be updated. When enabled, a map tile counter will also be displayed.
| - Clear Minimap               | Clears the map tile counter and all minimap data.
| **Debug Settings**            | Located within the Game menu

|&nbsp;|
| **RNG Control**               | Pre-determine boss patterns
| - Rerandomize                 | Toggles rerandomizing of RNG values upon loading a savestate. Automatically disabled in rooms with "seeded" RNG, but some of these situations may not be accounted for yet. Not available on some platforms.
| - Phantoon                    | Configure possible Phantoon patterns. You can enable or disable individual patterns per-round, allowing you to practice only a subset of possible patterns. The round-1 toggles apply only to the first round, whereas the round-2 toggles apply to all subsequent rounds, including rounds where Phantoon is invisible.
|                               | If all patterns are enabled (or disabled) for a round, vanilla RNG is used with all its quirks and biases. However, if you customize the patterns for a round, that round will use a customized RNG that chooses patterns with mostly-balanced probabilities (though slower patterns may still tend to be slightly more common).
|                               | - Phan Eye Close: Choose how long Phantoon's eye will remain open after a ring of flames
|                               | - Phan Flame Pattern: Choose one of four patterns for Phantoon's flames
|                               | - Next Flame Pattern: Swaps with Phan Flame Pattern each time Phantoon chooses a pattern
| - Botwoon First               | Choose the movement pattern for Botwoon's first cycle. The pattern names represent the hole Botwoon will the cycle at.
| - Bot Hidden                  | Choose the movement pattern for Botwoon's hidden cycle behind the background. Each pair of letters respresets the start and end position of the pattern.
| - Botwoon Second              | Choose the movement pattern for Botwoon's second and subsequent cycles. Each pair of letters respresets the start and end position of the pattern.
| - Botwoon Spit                | Choose whether Botwoon will spit projectiles or not, when possible
| - Draygon from Right          | Choose Draygon's attack type from the right side of the room. Draygon will always 'swoop' after a 'goop'.
| - Draygon from Left           | Choose Draygon's attack type from the left side of the room. Draygon will always 'swoop' after a 'goop'.

| - Kraid Claw RNG              | Set Kraid's claws to spawn above or below. Kraid is laggier when coming out of the ground if both claws spawn below. 
|                               | **Note**: It is not possible for both claws to spawn above Kraid, so there will always be some lag generated by a claw below.
| - Kraid Wait RNG              | Set amount of frames Kraid waits before opening mouth at start of second phase, or between attacks during the first phase.
|&nbsp;|

| - Rerandomize                 | Toggles rerandomizing of RNG values upon loading a savestate. Automatically disabled in rooms with "seeded" RNG, but some of these situations may not be accounted for yet.
| - Freeze on Load State        | Experimental feature that causes the game to be frozen until a new controller 1 input is made.
|                               | It also resets the segment timer. Beware that since it leverages the existing frame advance feature, toggling this on changes the way frame advance works.
| - Auto-Save Mid Door          | Creates a savestate in the middle of the next door transition.
| - Auto-Save Every Door        | Creates a savestate in the middle of every door transition.

| **Customize Menu**            | Change color palettes and sound effects used by the practice hack menus
| - Menu Background             | Toggle the background of the menu on or off. The background will always be drawn in the pause menu and Ceres Elevator Room.
| - Customize Menu Palette      | Customize the color palettes of each element of the menu. There are three sets of options for editing colors. The Hexadecimal set is an approximation of traditional 24bit RGB values. The Decimal set is a simplified version with a scale of 0-31 for each color. The SNES BGR set is the 15bit color value used internally, which is also how it's displayed in the "Screenshot To Share Colors" submenu. Example menu items are provided to show your changes in real time.
| - Menu Palette                | Cycle through a list of pre-made palette profiles from the community. Select CUSTOM to edit your own palettes.
| - Copy Palette to Custom      | Copy the selected Menu Palette to the CUSTOM profile to use as a base. A confirmation submenu will remind you that this will overwrite your existing CUSTOM profile.
| - Randomize Custom Palette    | Use RNG values to randomize the color palettes. A confirmation submenu will warn you that this will overwrite your existing CUSTOM profile.

# Lag Frames

Super Metroid runs at ~60 fps (NTSC) or ~50 fps (PAL). On each frame, the game simultaneously renders the current frame while preparing the next frame. If it fails to prepare the next frame in time, then the previous frame is rendered again. We call this a lag frame.
This means that game lag depends on how much work the CPU needs to do to prepare the next frame. It follows that any modification to game code could impact the game lag. Thus we need to balance the desire for practice ROM features with the desire for performance accuracy (matching the actual game lag).
&nbsp;  
You might be wondering how we were able to add features at all, since generally adding features means adding work. In fact even if a feature is toggled off, the game may have to check that the feature is toggled off and that is more work.
Fortunately it was discovered that the minimap adds a noticeable amount of work to each frame, and by disabling the minimap we freed up CPU for our features. In fact, we even had to add artificial lag in order to more closely match actual game performance.
Unfortunately we weren't the only ones to notice this. Deer Force knew, and they also knew boss fights were laggy, so they disabled the minimap for most boss fights.
As a result, with default settings the practice ROM will have very similar lag compared to the actual game, except the practice ROM may have more lag during boss fights.
&nbsp;  
As we continue to maintain and add features to the practice ROM, this is our strategy for managing lag:

| <th width="600" />            |       |
| :---                          | :---  |
| - Normal Gameplay             | With default settings (enemy HP selected in the infohud), we really try not to change lag. If we do, it will be communicated.
|                               | If you select other infohud or room strat options, lag may have a slight variance although it typically won't be noticeable.
| - Events                      | On events (when drops appear, when an item is collected, etc.), we may add features. It's conceivable this could add a lag frame, although in most circumstances it would be unlikely or impossible.
| - Door/Elevator Transitions   | Similar to events, we may add features during this time. Some features require data to be reloaded during this time.
| - Practice Features           | Once you start turning on practice features, lag may no longer be similar to actual game. Some features like magic pants or the metronome may not have much impact, but others like the OOB tile viewer add a significant amount of work for the CPU.
| - Sprite Patches              | Sprite patches such as SpriteSomething should be supported. These patches sometimes modify the game and theoretically could affect lag on their own, although if you intend to play the vanilla game or randomizer with a sprite patch then you might as well apply it to the practice ROM. You may need to turn on Compressed Graphics/Palettes/Tables in Preset Options as SpriteSomething will overwrite some data used to load presets (and in some cases savestates) faster.
